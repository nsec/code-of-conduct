# NorthSec 2024 Transparency Report
NorthSec strives to be an inclusive, friendly, and welcoming community to all people. As a part of our ongoing efforts to promote safer spaces in the tech fields, we:

- explicitly required all attendees, speakers, and sponsors, to adhere to our [Code of Conduct](https://nsec.io/code-of-conduct) during registration.
- assigned staff members to act as contacts for any reports that the attendees might have.
- reminded our attendees during each major announcement, both to follow the CoC and to report anything that might occur to us, whether it is via Discord, email, phone, or in person.

We take our code of conduct seriously and in the spirit of transparency, weâ€™re publishing a summary of the reports we received this year.

We appreciate those reports, and we encourage anyone who witnesses a code of conduct violation to report it via the methods listed on [https://nsec.io/code-of-conduct](https://nsec.io/code-of-conduct). NorthSec 2024 had two potential code of conduct incidents reported to the organizers. Anonymized details of these reports are below:

## Incidents

Following NorthSec 2024, here is an anonymized list of CoC-related incidents that occurred during the event:

- Two people exposed a small portion of their buttocks to a photobooth that was left unattended by a sponsor during Thursday's party. This behaviour goes against our code of conduct (Gratuitous, unwelcome or off-topic sexual imagery or behaviour). The offenders have been contacted and warned.
- During Saturday's costume contest, the presenter made a mistake and asked a contestant on stage to "show their feet" instead of "show their shoes". The crowd then chanted everybody who went on stage from this point on to "show their feet". Following this, we received multiple reports of harassment all related to feet (sexual attention and remarks in the absence of active and affirmative consent). We trusted the community not to take the "joke" too far, but we were wrong. We should have recognized the risk and taken the opportunity to explicitly remind people to respect our code of conduct.

As we already mentioned, this report is anonymized and published for the sake of maintaining transparency, and to encourage folks in our community to report incidents that might disrupt the atmosphere we are passionate about.
